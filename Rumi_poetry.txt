funknown existence
undiscovered beauty
that's how you are
so far
one dawn
just like a sun
right from within
you will arise


IN THIS EARTH

in this earth
in this earth
in this immaculate field
we shall not plant any seeds
except for compassion
except for love


ALL THE PRECIOUS WORDS

all the precious words
you and i have exchanged
have found their way
into the heart of the universe
one day they'll pour on us
like whispering rain
helping us arise
from our roots again


THE SWEETHEART

the sweetheart
who is blocking my sleep
demands tears on my knees
throwing me silently
into the waves
changing the water
to liquid sweet


I KNOW OF A PATH IN YOUR HEART

i know of a path in your heart
that merges with mine
my sweetheart

within me
that mirrors your moon-face
with delight


I SHALL TALK TO YOU

i shall talk to you
with no words
i shall whisper to you
no ears will hear
even if among the crowd
i tell my story
i know my tales
can only nest in your ears


MY SWEETHEART

my sweetheart
the idol of ecstasy
sat by mi side
filled with nirvana
embracing the
silken string harp
playing the tune
"i am happy
and i am here
without me"


ITS HIGH TIME

it's high time
to be only thinking of you
heating your body
with flame and glow
you are a gold mine
hidden in the earth
to purify you
we must set you
on fire


I CAN SEE MYSELF

i only see myself
coming and going for you
i only see myself
wishing and looking for you
even if i falter
everywhere in this world
isn't it because
i see nothing but you


THE SWEETHEART IN MY DREAM

the sweetheart in my dream
last night
had the soul and body
of a silver sea
asking everyone
today as i seek
hoping again to find
longing again to see


IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY

if you want to be happy
and dwell with me
let go of your
double heartedness and be
then you'll become
you with me as you were
and i'll become
me with you as i was


YOU ARE THE LETTER

you are the letter
written by God
you are the mirror
that reflects the divine
seek inside for
all you want is all you are
there is nothing
above and beyond


YOUR SOUL AND MINE

your soul and mine
were one at the roots
our in and out
were one at the heart
i am naive
calling that yours or mine
since me and you
has vanished
from
you and i


THIS LOVE IS THE OWNER

this love is the owner
of my bread cloth and home
this love has taken
my body eyes and soul
there is one more thing
it's taken away from me
i can't tell
till there is
the right group
place and time


TAKE ME IN MY LOVE

take me in my love
take my soul
set me on ecstasy
take both of my worlds
if i rest my heart on
anything but you
throw me with fireball
take evrything i hold


WAKE UP

wake up
let's run wild
in the moonlight
wake up
let's interrupt
the sleep of marcissus
we've been sailing on ice
for a long time
it's high time to
venture the waves now


ALL I'VE ASKED FROM YOU

all i have asked from you
is you and you again
from your love
i have already spread our feast
i don't remember
what i dreamt last night
all i know is
i woke up drunk


I WAS IN RAGE

i was in rage
love said be wuiet
i kept silence
love said have you no rage
i was on fire
love said go tranquil
i went tranquil
love said have you no fire


I CAN'T LET YOU KNOW

i can't let you know
all the secrets
i can't open to you
all the doors
there is something inside
that makes me happy
but i can't put my finger
on its source


COME MY LOVE

come my love
you're the precious sun
without you
living colors
in leaves and gardens
are gone
without you it's all
dust and dark
come my love
my party has no spark


SWEETHEART I SEE MYSELF

sweetheart i see myself
very close to you
like earth
i welcome your every step
is it fair to call you
my entire world
and yet not
find you around


I CAME TO THIS WORLD

i came to this world
riding a horse named love
every night is bright
with ecstasy and delight
since in my religion
the intoxication by
pure wine is allowed
you will never see
my lips gone dried


ITS YOUR VOICE

it's your voice
making me sing so fine
hearing your call
and i am generous like God
you have owned me
a hundred times
buy me once more
give me a new life


THOSE EYES OF YOURS

those eyes of yours
teach me divine laws
that love of yours
makes my soul spark
if i am safe
from evil eyes
it's only because
i am blessed
by your eyes


LOVE AND LOVE ALONE

love and love alone
that's all i have known
in the beginning, the middle
and to the end unknown
someone is calling me
i think it's my soul
open the door
lazy in love
answer the call


MY DEAR HEART

my dear heart
hope is all you have
don't let it go
if the entire world
is up against you
hold onto your pal
there are wondrous
secrets going on


GOD WILL RENEW YOUR LIFE

God will renew your life
when this one is done
your essence remains
when the persihable is gone
love is
the water of life
step inside
every drop
of this sea
holds the promise
of a different life


WHEN I DIE

when i die
hand me over
to my sweetheart
one kiss
on my dead lips
don't be surprised
if i come alive


THERE WAS A TIME

there was a time
when my thought
soared as a king
or a time when i mourned
like a prisoner
those days are gone
and i have promised
not to take myself
seriously again


I DON'T REALLY NEED WINE

i don't really need wine
to get drunk
i don't really need music
to feel delight
without a wine pal
music and dance
i am intoxicated
happy and gone


IF YOU SEEK ETERNITY

if you seek eternity
don't fall asleep
get into love's fire
don't fall asleep
a hundred nights you slept
and reaped nothing
for God's sake just tonight
don't fall asleep


LOVING MY BELOVED

loving my beloved
i am happy tonight
leaving my worries alone
i am free tonight
dancing and praying
oh God
let the key to the dawn
be lost tonight


DAWN AGAIN AND MORNING

dawn again and morning
is unleashing someone's love
in a magic aroma
enough sleep the world is leaving
take a deep breath
or the caravan
will take away your share


YOU'VE FINALLY FILLED THE WORLD WITH HAPPINESS

you have finally filled the
world with happiness
the eart and the sky
are thrilled
no one is complaining
any more except
the unhapiness
since you broke
everyone free
from its chains


WHATEVER HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND ME LAST NIGHT

whatever happened between
you and me last night
i can neither write
nor say a word
the day i take my last journey
out of this old country
there will be legend
wrapped around my shroud


I SEEK FIRE

i seek fire
that's my longing for you
i seek a way out
that's how i am at your door
i am sick and tired
of being so unhappy
only you can show me
the time of my life


WHEN I FIRST FELL IN LOVE

when i first fell in love
my neighbors couldn't rest for
my long lamenting times
now that my lamenting
has gone down
the real love
begins to surface
as high fire
catches on
smoke disappears


IF YOU'RE A SEEKER

if you are a seeker
find the company
of seekers
if you are in love
sit by the gate
of those in love
when you have experienced it all
then leave the humans alone
take the company
of no one but God


I AM IN LOVE WITH LOVE

i am in love with love
love is in love with me
my body fell in love
with my soul
and my soul fell in love
with me
we take turns in loving
we take turns in being loved


LOVE IS

love is
a great suspended sea
full of old secrets
full of sinking souls
only a drop
holding a bit of hope
and the rest
nothing but fears


I'LL LEAP HUNDRED STAGES

i'll leap hundred stages
beyond any wisdom
i'll break free
from all known good or bad
there is so much goodness
hidden inside
i'll finally fall in love
with no one but me


ANY ONE IN LOVE

any one in love
will have no religion
in the religion of love
there is no heresy or faith
love knows no
body heart or soul
there is only
oneness and no more


YOUR LOVER MAY SEEM TIMID

your lover may seem timid
what can he do
sleepless
going around your home
what can he do
when he kisses a lock of your hair
don't get mad
if a madman doesn't try
to break the chain
what can he do


ALL THOSE IN LOVE ARE READY

all those in love are ready
to lose both worlds
in one stroke
let go of a
hundred years of life
in one day
travel a thousand miles
to experience a moment
and lose a thousand lives
for the sake of one heart


FALLEN IN LOVE WITH YOU

fallen in love with you
i will take no advice
i have tasted the poison
what good can sugar do
they say he is mad
and in chains
he must be put
mad is my heart
what is a chain
on my foot


IN THE JOURNEY OF LOVE

in the journey of love
a thousand hearts and souls
will not suffice
only a traveller
ready to give a hundred lives
in every step
and not look back
can take his path


SINCE I HAVE LEARNED

since i have learned
to love you
i have closed my eyes
to everyone
every flame
that love strikes
first catches on me
since i have been
scorched before


NO WAY I'LL LET ANYONE

no way i'll let anyone
take away this pain
no way i would
lose this love till i die
this gift of pain
given by my beloved
i won't exchange for all
the healing in the world


I AM READY TO BOW

i am ready to bow
to you my beloved
since today i am more
intoxicated than you are
i am ready to swear on this
but why swear
if you can't believe me
i'd rather have more wine


I KNOW THE HABITS

i know the habits
of my sweetheart
i am the oil and
the beloved's soul is fire
the tenderness of my soul
is from the light
my beloved beams
the darkness around
my sweetheart
is from the smoke
that i spread


I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOUR FACE

i am so in love with your face
what do you think i should do
i am shy to look at
your happy eyes
what do you think i should do
every moment
the pang of love
makes me scream
for God's sake
what do you think i should do


YOUR SUPER PERFECTION

your super perfection
teaches me how to love
i get my love poems and odes
by simply looking at you
my love poems and odes arrive
your dancing image
playing alive
on my heart's stage
that's the source
of my own happy dances


YOUR LOVE IS

your love is 
in place of religion
and faith for me
as long as i live
i don't want to learn
patience in love
i thought to leave you alone
for a few days
i simply couldn't
why pretend it now


I HAVE BECOME

i have become
the owner of a land
with no time and place
i have become mystic
of a treasure
filled with gold
with a heart burning
in the mother of pearl
i have become
a sea of gracing souls


I'M YOUR FLUTE

i'm your flute
i only drink
from your lips
unless you play me
i have no sound
of my own
if you see me silent
i'm treasuring
your sweetness within


I USED TO BE WISE AND CLEVER

i used to be wise and clever
just like you
i used to brush aside
all the claims of 
the existence of love
now that i'm lost
crazy and care free
it seems i have been
living this way
all along


THE DRUM BEGS FOR

the drum begs for
the drummer's beat
with every strike saying
i'll tell a new tale
if you beat me
with mercy or rage
like all lovers
i'll be happy 
to tell my tale


HIDE MY SECRETS

hide my secrets
within your soul
keep my world
hidden from your world
if your spirit lets you
wrap my spirit
with yours
make this heresy of mine
the guiding light of yours


LIFE WITHOUT YOU IS A WASTE

life without you is a waste
how can it be named life
if you're not there
i swear a little life without you
will not be called anything
but death


IF YOU'RE HAPPY

if you're happy
even for a moment
with your sweetheart
seize the moment
as the fulfillment
of your life
beware
let no breath
go to waste
since you will not find
that breath again


YOU'RE IN MY EYES OTHERWISE

you're in my eyes otherwise
how could i see
you're in my mind otherwise
how could i be in love
yonder where
i know not where
if your love is not there
how could i be present


THIS HEART WILL ONE DAY

this heart will one day
find you a sweetheart
this soul will one day
take you to the beloved
seize your pain as a blessing
your pain will one day
lead you to healing


YOU'RE LIKE A FLOWER

you're like a flower
born from the
essence of laughter
good fortune and happiness
you're free and luscious
like a blossoming branch


MY DEAR FRIEND

my dear friend
don't expect me
to sustain for you
in grief
don't expect anything
from me but happiness
intoxication and good times
since God created us
only for this
i wreck logic and
fight a sober mind


IF YOU WON'T FALL IN LOVE

if you won't fall in love
go spin your wool
hundreds of busy works
and changes of color
if your skull is empty
of the wine of love
you might as well
lick the bowl
of those who do


LOVE ARRIVED AND

love arrived and
like blood
filled my skin and veins
emptied me out and
re-filled with my friend
my beloved has taken over
every part of me
nothing is left for me
but an empty name


IF THERE IS NO FIRE

if there is no fire
in the heart
then what is this smoke
if it isn't incense burning
then what is this aroma
why me falling in love
and vanishing away
why a candle moth burning
yet happy in flame


FOR AWHILE WISDOM CAME

for awhile wisdom came
to advise the ones
who are in love
it sat by the wayside
to corrupt their way
since it found no room
within their minds
it kissed their feet
and went on its way


MAKE YOUR JOURNEY

make your journey
at night
since the night will lead you
to many secrets
and hide you
from your enemies
at night hearts are loving
and eyes sleepy
all night long
we're busy
with no one
but the sweetheart


ANYONE WHO IS NOT IN LOVE

anyone who is not in love
cannot be as light as a soul
like moon and stars
cannot be orbiting restlessly
hear it from me
as the final word
a flag can never dance
with no air and no wind


YOU'RE FULFILLED

you're fulfilled
i'm not
so what's the cure
if there's no love
what's the other choice
you said if i show patience
i'll be rewarded with faith
you're the believer of faith
tell me
without the beloved
what is a faith


THIS FLARING CHEST OF MINE

this flaring chest of mine
is filled
with my beloved's teachings
and today that i've fallen ill
is nothing but a fever of love
i'll be glad to avoid
anything my doctor my orders
except of course
for honey and wine
offered by my beloved's lips


WHO OWNS ALL THESE WINES

who owns all these wines
which have no grail
who set the trap
while we caught the bird
who owns all this
delicious honey
pistachio and almond
and pours it constantly
on every one
who falls in love


IN MY HEART

in my heart
inside and out
is all beloved
in my body
blood and veins
is none but beloved
how can there be any
room for religion
or Godlessness in me
since my existence
is overflowing
with beloved


SEARCHING FOR LOVE

searching for love
once in a while
we feel at a loss
feeling the pain
of separation
once in a while
we sizzle in fire
once you and i
are cleansed from
the you and the me
only then you and i
without this us
will be happy


I BREAK ALL THE RULES

i break all the rules
in pains and healings
i break all the rules
in love and sufferings
you saw me repent
many times with pure heart
now watch me break
my repentances all


I DON'T IMAGINE

i don't imagine
even our soul
is as close to us
as the one we love
i swear to God i never
try to remember my beloved
remembering is only
for those who are absent in us


MY DEAR HEART

my dear heart
you'll never lose
in love
how can you close
your soul while you become
the soul
in the beginning
you descended from
heavens to earth
and at the end
you'll ascend
from the earth to heaven


RISE O DAY

rise o day
the particles desire dancing
to the one
the air and the cosmos
are dancing
happy souls
with no head or feet
will be dancing
and i'll whisper
in your ear
where the dance
will take place


O LOVE

o love
they think of you
as an angel
or as a human
or above and beyond
the Solomon's seal
they think of you
as the soul's dwelling
in the universe's mold
but i live with you
as no one ever knows


THIS LOVE IS HEADING TO

this love is heading to
where the brave are
this bold deer moves
into the lion's den
this house of love
has flourished with
hopes and dreams
do you imagine
it will fall apart
without you


I WAS A PIOUS PREACHER

i was a pious preacher
you changed me to a poet
and in me you instilled
rebel rousing and
drunkenness in every feast
i was a solemn
man of sustained prayer
you made me the playing object
of street children


WITHOUT LOVE

without love
partying and good times
won't go very far
without love
human existence
won't elate and evolve
if a hundred drops of rain
fall from the clouds
over the sea
without the motion
of love
not one drop
can create a hidden
precious pearl


COME

come 
whoever you are
come
come again
even if you are godless
and a worshipper of
fire and idols
come
our home is the home of
never lsoing hope
come
even if you break
your repentance vows
a hundred times
come again
come


I AM NO LION

i am no lion 
to overpower my enemies
winning over myself
if i can
is enough
i am a child
whose teacher is love
surely master
won't let me grow
to be a fool


RESTLESS

restless
now i go to the door
now i go on the roof
till i see your face
i'll never know rest
this heart of mine
tears itself apart
and seeks no joy
but only wants to know
when you'll arrive
just come and see me
letting go of my wish
letting go of my pilgrimage
keeping one wish in my heart
making love to your desires


ALL MY FRIENDS

all my friends
departed like dreams
left alone
i called upon
one friend
to become
my entire dream
this is the one
who soothes my heart
with endless
tenderness and love
this dream too
as it arrives
i come alive and as it departs
i'm helpless again


BELIEVE ME

believe me
i wasn't always like this
lacking common sense
or looking insane
like you
i used to be clever 
in my days
not like today
with my own heart
drowning in its blood
always pushing
to be ahead and above
since i was not yet hunted down
by this
ever-increasing love



Unfold Your Own Myth by Rumi

Who gets up early
to discover the moment light begins?
Who finds us here circling, bewildered, like atoms?
Who comes to a spring thirsty
and sees the moon reflected in it?
Who, like Jacob blind with grief and age,
smells the shirt of his lost son
and can see again?
Who lets a bucket down and brings up
a flowing prophet?
Or like Moses goes for fire
and finds what burns inside the sunrise?

Jesus slips into a house to escape enemies,
and opens a door to the other world.
Soloman cuts open a fish, and there’s a gold ring.
Omar storms in to kill the prophet
and leaves with blessings.
Chase a deer and end up everywhere!
An oyster opens his mouth to swallow on drop.
Now there’s a pearl.
A vagrant wanders empty ruins.
Suddenly he’s wealthy.

But don’t be satisfied with stories, how things
have gone with others. Unfold
your own myth, without complicated explanation,
so everyone will understand the passage,
We have opened you.

Start walking toward Shams. Your legs will get heavy
and tired. Then comes a moment
of feeling the wings you’ve grown,
lifting.


A Great Wagon

Listen
When I see your face, the stones start spinning!
You appear; all studying wanders.
I lose my place.

Water turns pearly.
Fire dies down and doesn’t destroy.

In your presence I don’t want what I thought
I wanted, those three little hanging lamps.

Inside your face the ancient manuscripts
Seem like rusty mirrors.

You breathe; new shapes appear,
and the music of a desire as widespread
as Spring begins to move
like a great wagon.
Drive slowly.
Some of us walking alongside
are lame!

~

Today, like every other day, we wake up empty
and frightened. Don’t open the door to the study
and begin reading. Take down a musical instrument.

Let the beauty we love be what we do.
There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.

~

Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I’ll meet you there.

When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about.
Ideas, language, even the phrase each other
doesn’t make any sense.

~

The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.
Don’t go back to sleep.
You must ask for what you really want.
Don’t go back to sleep.
People are going back and forth across the doorsill
where the two worlds touch.
The door is round and open.
Don’t go back to sleep.

I would love to kiss you.
The price of kissing is your life.

Now my loving is running toward my life shouting,
What a bargain, let’s buy it.

~

Daylight, full of small dancing particles
and the one great turning, our souls
are dancing with you, without feet, they dance.
Can you see them when I whisper in your ear?

~

They try to say what you are, spiritual or sexual?
They wonder about Solomon and all his wives.

In the body of the world, they say, there is a soul
and you are that.

But we have ways within each other
that will never be said by anyone.

~

Come to the orchard in Spring.
There is light and wine, and sweethearts
in the pomegranate flowers.

If you do not come, these do not matter.
If you do come, these do not matter.




This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

The Gifts of the Beloved

Where will you find one more liberal than God?
He buys the worthless rubbish which is your wealth,
He pays you the Light that illumines your heart.
He accepts these frozen and lifeless bodies of yours,
And gives you a Kingdom beyond what you dream of,
He takes a few drops of your tears,
And gives you the Divine Fount sweeter than sugar.
He takes your sighs fraught with grief and sadness,
And for each sigh gives rank in heaven as interest.
In return for the sigh-wind that raised tear-clouds,
God gave Abraham the title of “Father of the Faithful.


LOVE SOUNDS THE MUSIC
OF THE SPHERES

O soul, if thou, too, wouldst be free,
Then love the Love that shuts thee in.
‘Tis Love that twisteth every snare;
‘Tis Love that snaps the bond of sin;
Love sounds the Music of the Spheres;
Love echoes through Earth’s harshest din.

The world is God’s pure mirror clear,
To eyes when free from clouds within.
With Love’s own eyes the Mirror view,
And there see God to self akin.


A Stone I died


A stone I died and rose again a plant;
A plant I died and rose an animal;
I died an animal and was born a man.
Why should I fear? What have I lost by death?


A New Rule
It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other,
to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene.
The lover is even worse than a drunkard.
I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold.
And what is that gold?

The lover is a king above all kings,
unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown.
The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak.
Why should he go begging door to door?

Last night that moon came along,
drunk, dropping clothes in the street.
“Get up,” I told my heart, “Give the soul a glass of wine.
The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden,
to taste sugar with the soul-parrot.”

I have fallen, with my heart shattered –
where else but on your path? And I
broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk,
don’t let me be harmed, take my hand.

A new rule a new law has been born:
break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower.

 At the Twilight
At the twilight, a moon appeared in the sky;

Then it landed on earth to look at me.

Like a hawk stealing a bird at the time of prey;

That moon stole me and rushed back into the sky.

I looked at myself, I did not see me anymore;

For in that moon, my body turned as fine as soul.

The nine spheres disappeared in that moon;

The ship of my existence drowned in that sea.

 Whoever Brought Me Here
All day I think about it, then at night I say it.
Where did I come from, and what am I supposed to be doing?
I have no idea.
My soul is from elsewhere, I’m sure of that,
and I intend to end up there.

This drunkenness began in some other tavern.
When I get back around to that place,
I’ll be completely sober. Meanwhile,
I’m like a bird from another continent, sitting in this aviary.
The day is coming when I fly off,
but who is it now in my ear who hears my voice?
Who says words with my mouth?

Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul?
I cannot stop asking.
If I could taste one sip of an answer,
I could break out of this prison for drunks.
I didn’t come here of my own accord, and I can’t leave that way.
Whoever brought me here, will have to take me home.

This poetry. I never know what I’m going to say.
I don’t plan it.
When I’m outside the saying of it,
I get very quiet and rarely speak at all.


We Are As The Flute
We are as the flute, and the music in us is from thee;
we are as the mountain and the echo in us is from thee.

We are as pieces of chess engaged in victory and defeat:
our victory and defeat is from thee,
O thou whose qualities are comely!

Who are we, O Thou soul of our souls,
that we should remain in being beside thee?

We and our existences are really non-existence;
thou art the absolute Being which manifests the perishable.

We all are lions, but lions on a banner:
because of the wind they are rushing
onward from moment to moment.

Their onward rush is visible,
and the wind is unseen:
may that which is unseen not fail from us!

Our wind whereby we are moved and our being are of thy gift;
our whole existence is from thy bringing into being.

There Is A Candle In Your Heart
There is a candle in your heart,
      ready to be kindled.
There is a void in your soul,
      ready to be filled.
You feel it, don’t you?
You feel the separation
      from the Beloved.
Invite Him to fill you up,
      embrace the fire.
Remind those who tell you otherwise that
      Love
      comes to you of its own accord,
      and the yearning for it
      cannot be learned in any school.



The Way Things Should
What will
our children do in the morning?

Will they wake with their hearts wanting to play,
the way wings
should?


Will they have dreamed the needed flights and gathered
the strength from the planets that all
men and women need to balance
the wonderful charms of
the earth

so that her power and beauty does not make us forget our own?


I know all about the ways of the heart – how it wants to be alive.


Love so needs to love
that it will endure almost anything, even abuse,
just to flicker for a moment. But the sky’s mouth is kind,
its song will never hurt you, for I sing those words.


What will our children do in the morning
if they do not see us
fly?

The Rubaiyat of Rumi
1.

Time bringeth swift to end
The rout men keep;
Death’s wolf is nigh to rend
These silly sheep.

See, how in pride they go
With lifted head,
Till Fate with a sudden blow
Smiteth them dead.

2.

Thou who lovest, life a crow,
Winter’s chill and winter’s snow,
Ever exiled from the vale’s
Roses red, and nightingales:

Take this moment to thy heart!
When the moment shall depart,
Long thou ‘lt seek it as it flies
With a hundred lamps and eyes.

3.

The heavenly rider passed;
The dust rose in the air;
He sped; but the dust he cast
Yet hangeth there.

Straight forward thy vision be,
And gaze not left or night;
His dust is here, and he
In the Infinite.

4.

Who was he that said
The immortal spirit is dead,
Or how dared he say
Hope’s sun hath passed away?

An enemy of the sun,
Standing his roof upon,
Bound up both his eyes
And cried: ‘Lo, the sun dies!’

5.

‘Who lifteth up the spirit,
Say, who is he?’
‘Who gave in the beginning
This life to me.

Who hoodeth, life a falcon’s,
Awhile mine eyes,
But presently shall loose me
To hunt my prize.’

6.

As salt resolved in the ocean
I was swallowed in God’s sea,
Past faith, past unbelieving,
Past doubt, past certainty.

Suddenly in my bosom
A star shone clear and bright;
All the suns of heaven
Vanished in that star’s light.

~

Flowers every night
Blossom in the sky;
Peace in the Infinite;
At peace am I.

Sighs a hundredfold
From my heart arise;
My heart, dark and cold,
Flames with my sighs.

7.

He that is my souls’ repose
Round my heart encircling goes,
Round my heart and soul of bliss
He encircling is.

Laughing from my earthy bed
Like a tree I lift my head,
For the Fount of Living mirth
Washes round my earth.

8.

The breeze of the morn
Scatters musk in its train,
Fragrance borne
From my fair love’s lane.

Ere the world wastes,
Sleep no more: arise!
The caravan hastes,
The sweet scent dies.

9.

If life be gone, fresh life to you
God offereth,
A life eternal to renew
This life of death.

The Fount of Immorality
In Love is found;
The come, and in this boundless sea
Of Love be drowned.

10.

Happy was I
In the pearl’s heart to lie;
Till, lashed by life’s hurricane,
Life a tossed wave I ran.

The secret of the sea
I uttered thunderously;
Like a spent cloud on the shore
I slept, and stirred no more.

11.

He set the world aflame,
And laid me on the same;
A hundred tongues of fire
Lapped round my pyre.

And when the blazing tide
Engulfed me, and I sighed,
Upon my mouth in haste
His hand He placed.

12.

Though every way I try
His whim to satisfy,
His every answering word
Is a pointed sword.

See how the blood drips
From His finger-tips;
Why does He find it good
To wash in my blood?

13.

Remembering Thy lip,
The ruby red I kiss;
Having not that to sip,
My lips press this.

Not to Thy far sky
Reaches my stretched hand,
Wherefore kneeling, I
Embrace the land.

14.

I sought a soul in the sea
And found a coral there;
Beneath the foam for me
An ocean was all laid bare.

Into my heart’s night
Along a narrow way
I groped; and lo! the light,
An infinite land of day.


The Lovers
The Lovers
will drink wine night and day.
They will drink until they can
tear away the veils of intellect and
melt away the layers of shame and modesty.
When in Love,
body, mind, heart and soul don’t even exist.
Become this,
fall in Love, and you will not be separated again.

The Chance of Humming
THE CHANCE OF HUMMING

A
man
standing on two logs in a river
might do all right floating with the current
while humming in the
now.

Though
if one log is tied to a camel,
who is also heading south along the bank – at the same pace-
all could still be well
with the
world

unless the camel
thinks he forgot something, and
abruptly turns upstream,
then

uh-oh.

Most minds
do not live in the present
and can stick to a reasonable plan; most minds abruptly turn
and undermine the

chance

of

humming.


That lives in us
If you put your hands on this oar with me,
they will never harm another, and they will come to find
they hold everything you want.


If you put your hands on this oar with me, they would no longer
lift anything to your
mouth that might wound your precious land-
that sacred earth that is
your body.


If you put your soul against this oar with me,
the power that made the universe will enter your sinew
from a source not outside your limbs, but from a holy realm
that lives in us.


Exuberant is existence, time a husk.

When the moment cracks open, ecstasy leaps out and devours space;
love goes mad with the blessings, like my words give.

Why lay yourself on the torturer’s rack of the past and future?

The mind that tries to shape tomorrow beyond its capacities
will find no rest.


Be kind to yourself, dear- to our innocent follies.

Forget any sounds or touch you knew that did not help you dance.

You will come to see that all evolves us.


If you put your heart against the earth with me, in serving
every creature, our Beloved will enter you from our sacred realm
and we will be, we will be
so happy.

Soul Receives From Soul
Soul receives from soul that knowledge,
therefore not by book nor from tongue.
If knowledge of mysteries come after
emptiness of mind, that is illumination of heart.

 

One Whisper of the Beloved
Lovers share a sacred decree –
to seek the Beloved.
They roll head over heels,
rushing toward the Beautiful One
like a torrent of water.

In truth, everyone is a shadow of the Beloved –
Our seeking is His seeking,
Our words are His words.

At times we flow toward the Beloved
like a dancing stream.
At times we are still water
held in His pitcher.
At times we boil in a pot
turning to vapor –
that is the job of the Beloved.

He breathes into my ear
until my soul
takes on His fragrance.
He is the soul of my soul –
How can I escape?
But why would any soul in this world
want to escape from the Beloved?

He will melt your pride
making you thin as a strand of hair,
Yet do not trade, even for both worlds,
One strand of His hair.

We search for Him here and there
while looking right at Him.
Sitting by His side we ask,
“O Beloved, where is the Beloved?”

Enough with such questions! –
Let silence take you to the core of life.

All your talk is worthless
When compared to one whisper
of the Beloved.


O You Who’ve gone on Pilgrimage
O you who’ve gone on pilgrimage –
where are you, where, oh where?
Here, here is the Beloved!
Oh come now, come, oh come!
Your friend, he is your neighbor,
he is next to your wall –
You, erring in the desert –
what air of love is this?
If you’d see the Beloved’s
form without any form –
You are the house, the master,
You are the Kaaba, you! . . .
Where is a bunch of roses,
if you would be this garden?
Where, one soul’s pearly essence
when you’re the Sea of God?
That’s true – and yet your troubles
may turn to treasures rich –
How sad that you yourself veil
the treasure that is yours!

No Self
Think of the phoenix coming up out of the ashes, but not flying off.
For a moment we have form.
How can we be conscious and you be conscious at the same time and separate?
Copper when an alchemist works on it loses it copper qualities.
Seeds in Spring begin to be trees, no longer seeds….
It’s not that I’ve done anything to deserve this attention from you.
Predestination and freewill: We can
argue them, but they are only ideas.
What’s real is a presence, like Shams.
Open Secret


Magnificent Existence
God has made existence magnificent,
He has made it through nonexistence.
He has concealed the sea
And exposed the foam,
Concealed the wind and displayed the dust.

The whirling dust flies like a dancer,
The wind is invisible, known only by trust,
The foam moves all about you,
But without the sea no whirling takes place.
Thought is hidden, speech is manifest.

 It is the Rule with drunkards
What may that gold be? The lover is the king of kings; it
means becoming secure from death and not caring for the golden crown.
The darvish in his cloak, and in his pocket the pearl – why
should he be ashamed of begging from door to door?
Last night that moon came along, having flung his girdle on the road, so
drunken that he was not aware that his girdle had fallen.
I said, “Leap up, my heart, place wine in the hand of the soul;
for such a time has befallen, it is time to be roistering.
“To become hand in hand with the garden nightingale, to fall
into sugar with the spiritual parrot.”
I, heart-forlorn and heart-yielded, fallen upon your way – by
Allah, I know of no other place to fall.
If I broke your bowl, I am drunk, my idol. I am drunk – leave
me not from you hand to fall into danger.
This is a newborn rule, a newly enacted decree – to shatter
glasses, and to fall upon the glassmaker!



I Was Dead
i was dead
i came alive
i was tears
i became laughter

all because of love
when it arrived
my temporal life
from then on
changed to eternal

love said to me
you are not
crazy enough
you don’t
fit this house

i went and
became crazy
crazy enough
to be in chains

love said
you are not
intoxicated enough
you don’t
fit the group

i went and
got drunk
drunk enough
to overflow
with light-headedness

love said
you are still
too clever
filled with
imagination and skepticism

i went and
became gullible
and in fright
pulled away
from it all

love said
you are a candle
attracting everyone
gathering every one
around you

i am no more
a candle spreading light
i gather no more crowds
and like smoke
i am all scattered now

love said
you are a teacher
you are a head
and for everyone
you are a leader

i am no more
not a teacher
not a leader
just a servant
to your wishes

love said
you already have
your own wings
i will not give you
more feathers

and then my heart
pulled itself apart
and filled to the brim
with a new light
overflowed with fresh life

now even the heavens
are thankful that
because of love
i have become
the giver of light

 If A Tree Could Wander
Oh, if a tree could wander

     and move with foot and wings!

It would not suffer the axe blows

     and not the pain of saws!

For would the sun not wander

     away in every night ?

How could at ev’ry morning

     the world be lighted up?

And if the ocean’s water

     would not rise to the sky,

How would the plants be quickened

     by streams and gentle rain?

The drop that left its homeland,

     the sea, and then returned ?

It found an oyster waiting

     and grew into a pearl.

Did Yusaf not leave his father,

     in grief and tears and despair?

Did he not, by such a journey,

     gain kingdom and fortune wide?

Did not the Prophet travel

     to far Medina, friend?

And there he found a new kingdom

     and ruled a hundred lands.

You lack a foot to travel?

     Then journey into yourself!

And like a mine of rubies

     receive the sunbeams? print!

Out of yourself ? such a journey

     will lead you to your self,

It leads to transformation

     of dust into pure gold!

 Confused and Distraught
Again I am raging,
I am in such a state by your soul that every
bond you bind, I break, by your soul.
I am like heaven, like the moon, like a candle by your glow;
I am all reason, all love, all soul, by your soul.

My joy is of your doing, my hangover of your thorn;
whatever side you turn your face,
I turn mine, by your soul.
I spoke in error;
it is not surprising to speak in error in this state,
for this moment I cannot tell cup from wine, by your soul.
I am that madman in bonds who binds the
“divs”; I, the madman,am a Solomon with the “divs”,
by your soul.

Whatever form other than love raises up its head from my
heart, forthwith I drive it out of the court of my heart,
by your soul.
Come, you who have departed, for the thing that departs
comes back; neither you are that,
by my soul, nor I am that, by your soul.

Disbeliever, do not conceal disbelief in your soul, for I will recite
the secret of your destiny, by your soul.
Out of love of Sham-e Tabrizi,
through wakefulness or nightrising,
like a spinning mote I am distraught, by your soul.

Be With Those Who Help Your Being
Be with those who help your being.
Don’t sit with indifferent people, whose breath
comes cold out of their mouths.
Not these visible forms, your work is deeper.

A chunk of dirt thrown in the air breaks to pieces.
If you don’t try to fly,
and so break yourself apart,
you will be broken open by death,
when it’s too late for all you could become.

Leaves get yellow. The tree puts out fresh roots
and makes them green.
Why are you so content with a love that turns you yellow?

Ghazal 314
You who are not kept anxiously awake for love’s sake, sleep on.
In restless search for that river, we hurry along;
you whose heart such anxiety has not disturbed, sleep on.
Love’s place is out beyond the many separate sects;
since you love choosing and excluding, sleep on.
Love’s dawn cup is our sunrise, his dusk our supper;
you whose longing is for sweets and whose passion is for supper, sleep on.
In search of the philosopher’s stone, we are melting like copper;
you whose philosopher’s stone is cushion and pillow, sleep on.
I have abandoned hope for my brain and head; you who wish for
a clear head and fresh brain, sleep on.
I have torn speech like a tattered robe and let words go;
you who are still dressed in your clothes, sleep on.

 Ghazal 119
I don’t need
a companion who is
nasty sad and sour
the one who is
like a grave
dark depressing and bitter
a sweetheart is a mirror
a friend a delicious cake
it isn’t worth spending
an hour with anyone else
a companion who is
in love only with the self
has five distinct characters
stone hearted
unsure of every step
lazy and disinterested
keeping a poisonous face
the more this companion waits around
the more bitter everything will get
just like a vinegar
getting more sour with time
enough is said about
sour and bitter faces
a heart filled with desire for
sweetness and tender souls
must not waste itself with unsavory matters
